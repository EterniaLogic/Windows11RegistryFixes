# Windows11RegistryFixes
Registry hacks to fix many common annoyances, such as the context menu, TPM, several checks, Bing Search, Cortana, ect. Some fixes taken from articles and adapted to work with a batch file instead.


* TPM Removal
* Computer requirements removal
* Right click context menu fix to older Win10- version
* Disable Bing / Search highlights in Task Menu
* Disable Cortana
* Disable startup lock screen
* faster shutdown time (5 seconds to 1 second)

if you do not want a specific fix, you will have to edit the batch file directly.
