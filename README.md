# Windows11RegistryFixes
Registry hacks to fix many common annoyances, such as the context menu, TPM, several checks, Bing Search, Cortana, ect. Some fixes taken from articles and adapted to work with a batch file instead.

if you do not want a specific fix, you will have to edit the batch file directly.
